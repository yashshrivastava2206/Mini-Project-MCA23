FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT

Functional requirements specify what the system or software should do or the actions it should perform. They describe the intended functionality, features, and capabilities of the system. These requirements outline the system's behavior, inputs. outputs, and interactions with users or other systems. Functional requirements are typically specific, measurable, and verifiable. Examples include user authentication, data input validation, report generation, and system integration.

⚫ Image Recognition: The augmented reality application should be able to

accurately detect and recognize specific image targets within the college brochure using the device's camera. ⚫ Digital Object Placement: Once an image target is recognized, the application

should overlay digital objects, such as 3D models or videos, onto the real-world

view captured by the camera in a precise and visually appealing manner.

• Interactive Features: The application should allow users to interact with digital objects, such as rotating, resizing, or tapping on them to trigger specific actions or information. ⚫ Content Playback: When an image target is detected, the application should

seamlessly play relevant videos or animations associated with that specific target, providing users with an engaging and immersive experience. ⚫ Multiple Image Targets: The application should support the detection and playback of digital content for multiple image targets within the college

brochure, allowing users to explore different sections or aspects of the college
