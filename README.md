<b> Image Recognition:</b> The augmented reality application should be able to

accurately detect and recognize specific image targets within the college brochure using the device's camera.

<p>
<b>Digital Object Placement:</b> Once an image target is recognized, the application

should overlay digital objects, such as 3D models or videos, onto the real-world

view captured by the camera in a precise and visually appealing manner.
</p>
<p>

<b> Interactive Features:</b> The application should allow users to interact with digital objects, such as rotating, resizing, or tapping on them to trigger specific actions or information. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Content Playback:</b> When an image target is detected, the application should

seamlessly play relevant videos or animations associated with that specific target, providing users with an engaging and immersive experience.
</p>
<p>
<b>Multiple Image Targets:</b> The application should support the detection and playback of digital content for multiple image targets within the college

brochure, allowing users to explore different sections or aspects of the college
